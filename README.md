# YouTube-Comment-Spam-Detection

## Abstract
 1. Classifying YouTube comments as it attracts malicious users and is a challenge since messages are short and rife with slangs,  symbols and abbreviations.
 2. Using Text classification and prediction model to predict YouTube comments are spam or not.
 3. Using bag-of-words and different machine learning algorithms for prediction
 4. Preprocessing the data to remove punctuations, plurals, to remove stop words, to record binary counts.
 5. Comparing various classification techniques and statistical analysis of results.

## Machine Learning Models

 The data was converted into numeric form using both CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer. The models were analyzed using data obtained   by train test split method and cross-validation. The following list of models were used for classification and clustering. 

 1. Classification techniques used:
 2. MultinomialNB Classifier
 3. BernoulliNB Classifier
 4. Decision Tree Classifier (criterion='entropy')
 5. K-nearest Neighbor Classifier (n_neighbors=5)
 6. Random Forest Classifier
 7. Voting Classifier
 8. Gradient Boosting Classifier

 Clustering technique used:
 1. KMeans Clustering (n_clusters=5)
